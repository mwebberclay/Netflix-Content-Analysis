# Netflix Content Analysis

## Description
In this project, I analyzed Netflix’s content library to uncover trends and insights about its movies and TV shows. The dataset includes information such as title, type, release year, rating, and more. This analysis provides valuable insights into Netflix’s content strategy and audience preferences.

## Key Findings
1. **Content Distribution:** The majority of Netflix’s library consists of **Movies (75%)**, while **TV Shows (25%)** make up a smaller portion.
2. **Content Growth Over Time:** Netflix’s content library has grown exponentially since 2010, with a significant increase in titles added each year, especially after 2014.
3. **Most Common Content Ratings:** The most common content ratings on Netflix are **TV-MA** (intended for mature audiences) and **TV-14** (suitable for viewers aged 14 and above).
4. **Top Content-Producing Countries:** The United States leads in producing the most content, followed by India and the United Kingdom.
